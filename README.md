# Dyve NFT Shorting

## Overview 
Dvye enables NFT shorting by allowing lenders to list their NFTs on the Dyve marketplace. Borrowers supply collateral Dyve and take custody of the NFT whereby they may sell the NFT and buy back another NFT of the same collection at a future date, hopelly at a lower price than what they sold. They may then return the NFT they purchase at a lower price back Dyve to release the collateral they posted at the orgiinal price and profit from the difference.
